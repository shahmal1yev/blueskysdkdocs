With the BlueSky PHP SDK, it\u2019s effortless. By \\nadding external content (externals) and images, you can enrich your posts and make them more captivating.\\n\\nIn this post, you\'ll learn how to authenticate with the SDK and embed external links, thumbnails, and images into your \\nposts.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Authentication\\n\\nThe first step to accessing the Bluesky network is authentication. Use the SDK to log in with your username and password:\\n\\n```php title=\\"Authenticate with Your Credentials\\"\\n<?php\\n\\nuse Atproto\\\\Client;\\n\\n$client = new Client();\\n$client->authenticate(\'handle\', \'password\'); // Replace with your Bluesky username and password\\n```\\n\\nOnce authenticated, you\'re ready to start creating posts! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Adding External Links\\n\\nWant to add external links, titles, descriptions, and even thumbnails to your posts? The SDK makes this simple. For \\ninstance, if you want to link to your personal blog or website, here\'s how you can do it:\\n\\n### Uploading a Thumbnail Image\\n\\nUpload an image to be used as a thumbnail for the external content:\\n\\n![Post image](post-image.png)\\n\\n```php\\n<?php\\n\\n$uploadedBlob = $client->com()->atproto()->repo()->uploadBlob()->forge()\\n    ->token($client->authenticated()->accessJwt())\\n    ->blob(\'path_of_image\') // File path of the image to be uploaded\\n    ->send()\\n    ->blob();\\n```\\n\\nThis uploaded image will serve as the thumbnail for your external content.\\n\\n### Creating the External Content\\n\\nAdd the URI, title, and description for the link, and use the uploaded image as the thumbnail:\\n\\n```php\\n<?php\\n\\n$external = $client->app()->bsky()->embed()->external()->forge(\\n    \'https://shahmal1yev.dev\', // URI\\n    \'Eldar Shahmaliyev\\\\\'s blog\', // Title\\n    \'A personal blog about cybersecurity and development.\' // Description\\n)->thumb($uploadedBlob); // thumbnail\\n```\\n\\n### Creating the Post\\n\\nAdd the prepared external content to your post and make it ready to share:\\n\\n```php\\n<?php\\n\\n$post = $client->app()->bsky()->feed()->post()->forge()\\n    ->text(\'Come to my blog: \')\\n    ->link(\'https://shahmal1yev.dev\', \'click here and read the posts\')\\n    ->embed($external);\\n```\\n\\nWith these steps, you\u2019re all set to add captivating external links to your Bluesky posts.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Adding Images\\n\\nWant to include one or multiple images in your posts? The SDK allows you to use the `ImageCollection` object for \\nthis purpose.\\n\\n### Creating an Image Collection\\n\\nFirst, upload the image and add it to an `ImageCollection` object:\\n\\n```php\\n<?php\\n\\nuse Atproto\\\\Lexicons\\\\App\\\\Bsky\\\\Embed\\\\Collections\\\\ImageCollection;\\nuse Atproto\\\\Lexicons\\\\App\\\\Bsky\\\\Embed\\\\Image;\\n\\n$uploadedBlob = $client->com()->atproto()->repo()->uploadBlob()->forge()\\n    ->token($client->authenticated()->accessJwt())\\n    ->blob(\'path_of_image\')\\n    ->send()\\n    ->blob();\\n\\n$images = new ImageCollection([\\n    new Image(\\n        $uploadedBlob, // Blob\\n        \'Alt text\' // Image description\\n    )\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n### Adding Images to the Post\\n\\nAttach the image collection to your post and get it ready to share:\\n\\n```php\\n<?php\\n\\n$post = $client->app()->bsky()->feed()->post()->forge()\\n    ->text(\'Check out my gallery: \')\\n    ->embed($images);\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Sharing the Post\\n\\nThe final step is to share your post on the Bluesky network. \ud83c\udf89\\n\\n```php\\n<?php\\n\\n$createRecord = $client->com()->atproto()->repo()->createRecord()->forge()\\n    ->record($post)\\n    ->repo($client->authenticated()->did())\\n    ->collection($post->nsid());\\n\\n$response = $createRecord->send();\\n\\necho $response->uri();\\n```\\n\\nOnce the process is complete, your post will be live on the Bluesky network!\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nCreating posts with the BlueSky PHP SDK is straightforward and offers a variety of options.

Well, you\'re in luck! With the **BlueSky PHP SDK**, it\'s surprisingly simple. In this post, I\'ll guide \\nyou step-by-step to authenticate, create posts, upload images, and share them effortlessly. Let\u2019s dive right in! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n---\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### Getting Started: Share Your First Post\\n\\nFirst things first\u2014you need to authenticate with your credentials. This is required because the \\n`app.bsky.feed.post` endpoint needs an access token to make things happen. \\nHere\u2019s how you can do it in just a few lines of PHP:\\n\\n```php title=\\"Authenticate with Your Credentials\\"\\n<?php\\n\\nuse Atproto\\\\Client;\\n\\n$client = new Client();\\n$client->authenticate(\'handle\', \'password\'); // Replace with your Bluesky username and password\\n```\\n\\nOnce you\'re authenticated, the SDK generates an access token for you, so you\u2019re ready to roll.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Creating the Magic (Your Post)\\n\\nNow that authentication is sorted, let\u2019s create your first post. Imagine writing something cool like, \\"Hey Bluesky, \\nI just discovered documentation!\\" Here\u2019s how you can code that moment:\\n\\n```php title=\\"Create Your First Post\\"\\n$post = $client->app()->bsky()->feed()->post()->forge()\\n    ->text(\'Hey Bluesky! I just discovered documentation, and it feels amazing! \ud83d\ude04\');\\n```\\n\\nSimple, isn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s take it up a notch by adding an image.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Adding a Touch of Visuals (Upload an Image)\\n\\nThey say a picture is worth a thousand words, and Bluesky posts are no exception! Here\u2019s how you can upload an \\nimage to make your post more engaging:\\n\\n```php title=\\"Upload an Image\\"\\n$uploadedBlob = $client->com()->atproto()->repo()->createRecord()->forge()\\n    ->blob(\'docs-released.png\') // Your image file here\\n    ->send()\\n    ->blob();\\n```\\n\\nCool, right? The uploaded image gets converted into a [`blob data model`](https://atproto.com/specs/blob) object, \\nwhich you\u2019ll need in the next step.\\n\\nTo help you visualize the flow, here\u2019s an image that represents what the process looks like when you\'re working \\nwith the BlueSky PHP SDK:\\n\\n![An example image for creating posts with BlueSky PHP SDK](docs-released.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Embedding the Image (Making It Shine)\\n\\nNow, let\u2019s embed that shiny new image into your post. Here\u2019s how:\\n\\n```php title=\\"Embed Image into Post\\"\\nuse Atproto\\\\Lexicons\\\\App\\\\Bsky\\\\Embed\\\\Collections\\\\ImageCollection;\\nuse Atproto\\\\Lexicons\\\\App\\\\Bsky\\\\Embed\\\\Image;\\n\\n$post->embed(new ImageCollection([\\n    new Image($uploadedBlob, \\"An example image for a Bluesky blog post\\")\\n]));\\n```\\n\\nBoom! Your post now has a visual element, and it\u2019s ready to be shared with the world.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 4: Hitting the Share Button (Publish the Post)\\n\\nHere comes the moment of truth\u2014publishing your post! Let\u2019s send it to the Bluesky network for everyone to see:\\n\\n```php title=\\"Publish Your Post\\"\\n$createdRecord = $client->com()->atproto()->repo()->createRecord()\\n    ->record($post)\\n    ->repo($client->authenticated()->did())\\n    ->collection($post->nsid())\\n    ->send();\\n```\\n\\nAnd guess what? Your post is live! \ud83c\udf89 If you want to grab the post\u2019s URI, here\u2019s how:\\n\\n```php title=\\"Get Post URI\\"\\necho $createdRecord->uri();\\n```\\n\\nThere you go\u2014your Bluesky post is out there, ready to make waves!\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Wrap-Up\\n\\nCongratulations! \ud83c\udf8a You\u2019ve just created and shared your first post on the Bluesky Social Network using the **BlueSky \\nPHP SDK**. Whether it\u2019s a simple update or a vibrant post with images, this SDK has got your back.\\n\\nUntil next time, happy coding and happy posting! \ud83d\ude80"}]}}')}}]);

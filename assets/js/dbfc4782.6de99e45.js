Well, you\'re in luck! With the **BlueSky PHP SDK**, it\'s surprisingly simple. In this post, I\'ll guide \\nyou step-by-step to authenticate, create posts, upload images, and share them effortlessly. Let\u2019s dive right in! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Getting Started: Share Your First Post\\n\\nFirst things first\u2014you need to authenticate with your credentials. This is required because the \\n`app.bsky.feed.post` endpoint needs an access token to make things happen. \\nHere\u2019s how you can do it in just a few lines of PHP:\\n\\n```php title=\\"Authenticate with Your Credentials\\"\\n<?php\\n\\nuse Atproto\\\\Client;\\n\\n$client = new Client();\\n$client->authenticate(\'handle\', \'password\'); // Replace with your Bluesky username and password\\n```\\n\\nOnce you\'re authenticated, the SDK generates an access token for you, so you\u2019re ready to roll.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Creating the Magic (Your Post)\\n\\nNow that authentication is sorted, let\u2019s create your first post. Imagine writing something cool like, \\"Hey Bluesky, \\nI just discovered documentation!\\" Here\u2019s how you can code that moment:\\n\\n```php title=\\"Create Your First Post\\"\\n$post = $client->app()->bsky()->feed()->post()->forge()\\n    ->text(\'Hey Bluesky! I just discovered documentation, and it feels amazing! \ud83d\ude04\');\\n```\\n\\nSimple, isn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s take it up a notch by adding an image.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Adding a Touch of Visuals (Upload an Image)\\n\\nThey say a picture is worth a thousand words, and Bluesky posts are no exception! Here\u2019s how you can upload an \\nimage to make your post more engaging:\\n\\n```php title=\\"Upload an Image\\"\\n$uploadedBlob = $client->com()->atproto()->repo()->createRecord()->forge()\\n    ->blob(\'docs-released.png\') // Your image file here\\n    ->send()\\n    ->blob();\\n```\\n\\nCool, right? The uploaded image gets converted into a [`blob data model`](https://atproto.com/specs/blob) object, \\nwhich you\u2019ll need in the next step.\\n\\nTo help you visualize the flow, here\u2019s an image that represents what the process looks like when you\'re working \\nwith the BlueSky PHP SDK:\\n\\n![An example image for creating posts with BlueSky PHP SDK](docs-released.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Embedding the Image (Making It Shine)\\n\\nNow, let\u2019s embed that shiny new image into your post. Here\u2019s how:\\n\\n```php title=\\"Embed Image into Post\\"\\nuse Atproto\\\\Lexicons\\\\App\\\\Bsky\\\\Embed\\\\Collections\\\\ImageCollection;\\nuse Atproto\\\\Lexicons\\\\App\\\\Bsky\\\\Embed\\\\Image;\\n\\n$post->embed(new ImageCollection([\\n    new Image($uploadedBlob, \\"An example image for a Bluesky blog post\\")\\n]));\\n```\\n\\nBoom! Your post now has a visual element, and it\u2019s ready to be shared with the world.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 4: Hitting the Share Button (Publish the Post)\\n\\nHere comes the moment of truth\u2014publishing your post! Let\u2019s send it to the Bluesky network for everyone to see:\\n\\n```php title=\\"Publish Your Post\\"\\n$createdRecord = $client->com()->atproto()->repo()->createRecord()\\n    ->record($post)\\n    ->repo($client->authenticated()->did())\\n    ->collection($post->nsid())\\n    ->send();\\n```\\n\\nAnd guess what? Your post is live! \ud83c\udf89 If you want to grab the post\u2019s URI, here\u2019s how:\\n\\n```php title=\\"Get Post URI\\"\\necho $createdRecord->uri();\\n```\\n\\nThere you go\u2014your Bluesky post is out there, ready to make waves!\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Wrap-Up\\n\\nCongratulations! \ud83c\udf8a You\u2019ve just created and shared your first post on the Bluesky Social Network using the **BlueSky \\nPHP SDK**. Whether it\u2019s a simple update or a vibrant post with images, this SDK has got your back.\\n\\nUntil next time, happy coding and happy posting! \ud83d\ude80"}]}}')}}]);

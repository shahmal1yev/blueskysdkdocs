Hey there! ðŸŽ‰ Have you ever wondered how to programmatically create and share posts on the **Bluesky Social 
Network**? Well, you're in luck! With the **BlueSky PHP SDK**, it's surprisingly simple. In this post, I'll guide 
you step-by-step to authenticate, create posts, upload images, and share them effortlessly. Letâ€™s dive right in! ðŸš€

### Getting Started: Share Your First Post

First things firstâ€”you need to authenticate with your credentials. This is required because the 
`app.bsky.feed.post` endpoint needs an access token to make things happen. 
Hereâ€™s how you can do it in just a few lines of PHP:

```php title="Authenticate with Your Credentials"
<?php

use Atproto\Client;

$client = new Client();
$client->authenticate('handle', 'password'); // Replace with your Bluesky username and password
```

Once you're authenticated, the SDK generates an access token for you, so youâ€™re ready to roll.

### Step 1: Creating the Magic (Your Post)

Now that authentication is sorted, letâ€™s create your first post. Imagine writing something cool like, "Hey Bluesky, 
I just discovered documentation!" Hereâ€™s how you can code that moment:

```php title="Create Your First Post"
$post = $client->app()->bsky()->feed()->post()->forge()
    ->text('Hey Bluesky! I just discovered documentation, and it feels amazing! ðŸ˜„');
```

Simple, isnâ€™t it? Letâ€™s take it up a notch by adding an image.

---

### Step 2: Adding a Touch of Visuals (Upload an Image)

They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and Bluesky posts are no exception! Hereâ€™s how you can upload an 
image to make your post more engaging:

```php title="Upload an Image"
$uploadedBlob = $client->com()->atproto()->repo()->createRecord()->forge()
    ->blob('docs-released.png') // Your image file here
    ->send()
    ->blob();
```

Cool, right? The uploaded image gets converted into a [`blob data model`](https://atproto.com/specs/blob) object, 
which youâ€™ll need in the next step.

To help you visualize the flow, hereâ€™s an image that represents what the process looks like when you're working 
with the BlueSky PHP SDK:

### Step 3: Embedding the Image (Making It Shine)

Now, letâ€™s embed that shiny new image into your post. Hereâ€™s how:

```php title="Embed Image into Post"
use Atproto\Lexicons\App\Bsky\Embed\Collections\ImageCollection;
use Atproto\Lexicons\App\Bsky\Embed\Image;

$post->embed(new ImageCollection([
    new Image($uploadedBlob, "An example image for a Bluesky blog post")
]));
```

Boom! Your post now has a visual element, and itâ€™s ready to be shared with the world.

---

### Step 4: Hitting the Share Button (Publish the Post)

Here comes the moment of truthâ€”publishing your post! Letâ€™s send it to the Bluesky network for everyone to see:

```php title="Publish Your Post"
$createdRecord = $client->com()->atproto()->repo()->createRecord()
    ->record($post)
    ->repo($client->authenticated()->did())
    ->collection($post->nsid())
    ->send();
```

And guess what? Your post is live! ðŸŽ‰ If you want to grab the postâ€™s URI, hereâ€™s how:

```php title="Get Post URI"
echo $createdRecord->uri();
```

There you goâ€”your Bluesky post is out there, ready to make waves!

### Wrap-Up

Congratulations! ðŸŽŠ Youâ€™ve just created and shared your first post on the Bluesky Social Network using the **BlueSky 
PHP SDK**. Whether itâ€™s a simple update or a vibrant post with images, this SDK has got your back.

Until next time, happy coding and happy posting! ðŸš€
